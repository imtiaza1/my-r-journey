# R structure 
# data structure are to store organize values
# r provide many build in data structures--vector matrix array list data frames
# vectors is the most basic data structure in r its can hold of element of the same type

# -------problem cleaning vector_______----
ages <- c(25, 30, NA, 25, 40, 18, NA, 30)

unique(ages) #remove duplicate values
sort(ages) # sorting the cleaned vector in ascending order
length(ages>25) # count people are above 25 years old
mean(cleaned) # find the average age of cleaned vector

#________Problem 2: Logical Filtering_____----
temps <- c(34, 39, 42, 28, 31, 35, 40,43)

#______________Problem 4: Name Filtering with %in%_______-----

#_______Problem 6: Student Scores______----
