# Variables in R ----
# We can create variables using "=" or "<-"
# But R recommends using "<-" because "=" is mostly used inside functions

# variables type in R 
# Numeric
x <- 10


# Integer
y <- 5L


# Character
name <- "String"


# Logical
isPassed <- TRUE

# Complex
z <- 4 + 2i

 # checking data type in R 

class(isPassed)

# Output in R ----
# You can just write a variable or value, and R will show it.
# But if your code is inside curly braces `{ }`, then use print() to make sure it shows the result.

print("Hello")






# Concatenate element ----
#  we can use concatenate or join two or more element by using past() func
# two combine both text and a variable r us comma (,)
text <- "hello"
text1 <- "ali"

paste(text, "ali")

#we can also use comma to add variable to another
paste(text,text1)
 # for the number the + character work as a mathematical operators
number<-2
number1 <-3
number + number1

# if you combine a string(text) and a number R will give you error 
number+text

# Multiple Variables ----
# R allows us to assign the same value to multiple in one lines:
var1 <- var2 <- var3<- "apple"
print(var1)

 # Variable Name ----
 #  a variable name must start with letter n can be combine with letter digit n dot 
 # a variable name can't be start with "_" and numbers
 # variable name are case sensitive (age,Age are different variables)

# Legal variable names:
myvar <- "John"
my_var <- "John"
myVar <- "John"
MYVAR <- "John"
myvar2 <- "John"
.myvar <- "John"



# R Math ----
# In R can use operators to perform common mathematical operation on numbers

# build in math funtion 
 # R also has many build-in function that allows us to perform math task on numbers

# eg 

min(10,2,3,4) # its find the lowest number
max(1,2,3,4,4) # its find the highest number
sqrt(9) # this return the square root of a number
abs(-4.7)# this fun returns the positive value of number
ceiling(1.4) # round a number upwards to its nearest integer
floor(1.4) # round a number downwards to its nearest integer
